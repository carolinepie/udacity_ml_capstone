This project is the capstone project of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nano degree program. It is intended to be run on AWS Sagemaker.


How to navigate code for this project:

  For data processing: run the data_exploration.ipynb notebook in capstone_data/
  For HAR benchmark model: run the har_model.ipynb notebook after data processing has completed
  For LSTM model: the training workflow is held in lstm_model.ipynb notebook, but actual model implementation, including train and predict scripts and necessary helper classes are held in the lstm folder
